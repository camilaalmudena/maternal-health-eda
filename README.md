# maternal-health-eda
A personal data science project analyzing maternal and newborn health data. Includes exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, visualization, linear regression, and clustering with PCA and K-means. Focused on understanding patterns, correlations, and trends in medical datasets.

This repository contains a hands-on learning project in medical data science. It covers:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Feature categorization based on medical guidelines (e.g., high-risk pregnancies, prematurity)

Correlation analysis

Linear regression on features with apparent linear relationships

Clustering using K-means and dimensionality reduction with PCA

The goal is to practice data science techniques while gaining insight into maternal and neonatal health patterns.
